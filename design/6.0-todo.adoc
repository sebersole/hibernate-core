= Active questions and todo list for 6.0

A list of work to do (and questions to be answered) with regard to ORM 6.0 and 6.x.

This categorization follows the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method[MoSCoW] paradigm.

== Must

Things listed as `must` are things that have to be implemented for 6.0.  We break these
down into various unstable release categories for scheduling purposes.  Some items may be
promoted (from Alpha2 to Alpha1 e.g.) or demoted (from Alpha1 to Alpha2 e.g.) as resources
dictate.

Once Alpha1 is released, the plan is to enter a timebox schedule for the others - most
likely a 6-week timebox schedule.

As always the "trigger" for Beta1 is (relatively) stable API.

=== Alpha1

* Mappings
** ManyToOne
	*** Bidirectional
** OneToOne
** OneToMany
** ManyToMany

* Fetching
* Cascading
* Batching

* CRUD
** Delete
** Update

* [.line-through]#Drop `Query#iterate` support (shallow queries)?#
* [.line-through]#Determine how to deal with `JpaExpression#getExpressionSqmType`.
	It is only used in "basic contexts" (function return types, arithmetic results, etc)#
* [.line-through]#split concept of NavigablePath and NavigableRole (PropertyPath renamed). NavigablePath represents an ongoing path in a query; NavigableRole represents the static role of an attribute in relation to a root entity#
* [.line-through]#find all usage of `LoadPlan` and replace it with	`org.hibernate.sql.ast.produce.spi.SqlSelectPlan` / `org.hibernate.sql.exec.spi.JdbcSelect`. This will include the following (and more probably) replacements:#
	** `AssociationVisitationStrategy` -> `NavigableVisitationStrategy`
	** `EntityDefinition` -> ? `EntityReference` or `EntityPersister`?
	** `AttributeSource` -> ? `PersistentAttribute` or `Navigable`?
	** `org.hibernate.loader.plan.spi.Return` -> `org.hibernate.sql.ast.produce.result.spi.Return`
		*** `org.hibernate.loader.plan.spi.ScalarReturn` ->
			`org.hibernate.sql.ast.produce.result.spi.ReturnScalar`
		*** `org.hibernate.loader.plan.spi.EntityReturn` ->
			`org.hibernate.sql.ast.produce.result.spi.ReturnEntity`
		*** etc..
	** `org.hibernate.loader.plan.spi.QuerySpaces` -> `org.hibernate.sql.ast.tree.spi.from.FromClause` ?
		*** `org.hibernate.loader.plan.spi.QuerySpace` -> `org.hibernate.sql.ast.tree.spi.from.TableSpace`
		*** etc..
	** etc..
* need to investigate the impact on counter-parts for "result assembly".
* be sure to test bi-directional "key-many-to-one" references.  That is something LoadPlan code does a lot of
	work to handle properly.  Need to find the test that Gail wrote for this.
* prior to release, look at the Alpha2 list and see if there is any "low-hanging fruit" we could
* [.line-through]#Make Byte Buddy the default bytecode provider#
* Make sure we have added `@since 6.0` to all major API/SPI contracts we have added in 6.0 dev.  Also,
 	add `@Incubating` to those where appropriate.  ? - Is it valid to apply the `@Incubating` annotation
 	at the package level?
* CollectionTuplizer (see "Open questions" discussion below) or some way to handle role of CollectionType.


=== Alpha2

* Mappings
	** Inheritance

* RepresentationMode

* General "literal as JDBC parameter" feature based on SQM?  I currently have
		added this via the `org.hibernate.query.QueryLiteralRendering` enum and
		`SessionFactoryOptions.getQueryLiteralRendering`
* When not rendering literals as parameters:
	** if they occur in SELECT, wrap in cast function based on Java type (?Dialect-specific?)
	** define a better scheme for rendering these as SQL literals.  This could possibly be something
		like the legacy `org.hibernate.query.criteria.internal.ValueHandlerFactory`.  Another option
		(my preference), considering literals must be basic types (?allow composites?) is to define a
		`BasicType#getLiteralRenderer` (as well as an inverse `BasicType#getLiteralConsumer`).
* Be sure to implement Callback handling for "subsequent actions" such as...
	** follow-on locking
	** join fetch conversions to subselect fetches - immediately improves our subselect fetch handling simply
		by having a SQL AST so we can know what to build the "subselect" based on - no more bug-prone String manip.
* dynamic-instantiations selecting an entity reference as a ctor argument - we will change to interpret this
	as (1) fully select (no implicit fetching) that entity and (2) look for constructors with arguments
	of the same castable type as the entity; for the short term we will have a backwards compatability flag for the
	old behavior, but using it should log a "deprecation warning".
* Drop old QueryTranslator and both impls
* Finish removing `#fromString` and `#toString` impls from various `BasicJavaDescriptor` impls and
	(use the default impl) move handling of String-based conversions into `#wrap` and `#unwrap`.
	Tedious task, so adding a todo note here - bu partially done.
* Parameterized ScrollableResults signature - change signature of row access methods or add new row access methods?
* Redesign Cache SPI as per https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-10707?focusedCommentId=84079&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-84079
	and https://gist.github.com/sebersole/2c9ad6b77ea3477ba508c21c6ab61b8d.  See https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-11356
* Change how we handle boolean/Boolean types in terms of JavaTypeDescriptor, specifically how we convert them
	to/from their representation in the database (most databases do not support a boolean data type) such as
	1/0, 'T'/'F', 'Y'/'N', etc.  The initial design plan is to leverage AttributeConverter on the Navigable
	for this purpose:
	** If the user has attached an AttributeConverter to the attribute we'd simply use that
	** Otherwise, we'd look to a config setting that tells us the true/false storage values
	** Finally we'd ask the Dialect


=== Beta1

* Find deprecations and evaluate for removal.  This should not be done in an Alpha in order to make it easier for early
 	adopters to try out the release using as much of their 5-based code as possible.  Should be done in the first
 	Beta however.
* Find incubations and evaluate for promotion
* Remove the Javassist bytecode provider (Byte Buddy was already made the default in Alpha1)
* Remove vast majority of legacy criteria package.  We all agree it would be a good idea to continue
	to support the "criterion/restriction factory contracts", although moved to our expanded
	JPA CriteriaBuilder specialization (`org.hibernate.query.criteria.HibernateCriteriaBuilder`), possibly
	with a set of similar specializations for the JPA criteria nodes.  We should analyze all specific
	Criterion/Restriction impls that make sense to port to the JPA model, including discussed CTE
	support (sub-query as part of FROM clause) - Christian.  Any known custom impls that make sense?  Call
	to community?


== Should

`Should` indicates items that should get done for 6.0.  Again, some may get pushed to a future
6.x release as resources dictate.  As we move along development for 6.0, these items will get
scheduled appropriately.

* Support for using anonymous call blocks as `org.hibernate.query.sqm.consume.multitable.spi.IdTableStrategy`
* Move `org.hibernate.secure` to `org.hibernate.resource.jacc`? - https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-11478
* Move `org.hibernate.jmx` to `org.hibernate.resource.jmx`? - https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-11478
* Remove HQLQueryPlan and current QueryPlanCache - see `org.hibernate.query.spi.SelectQueryPlan`
	and `org.hibernate.query.spi.QueryInterpretations`.  Determine what to do with
	`org.hibernate.engine.query.spi.NativeSQLQueryPlan`.
* Consider dropping `org.hibernate.cache.spi.QueryCache` in favor of direct coordination between:
	** `org.hibernate.cache.spi.QueryResultsRegion`
	** `org.hibernate.cache.spi.UpdateTimestampsCache`
	** a new "results validation checker", something like:
+
--
	interface QueryCacheResultsValidator {
		boolean areCachedResultsValid(
				UpdateTimestampsCache timestampsCache,
				Set<Serializable> spaces,
				Long timestamp,
				SharedSessionContractImplementor session);
	}
--
* Another literal related idea is to simply not render them into the SQL but instead transfer them directly to
	the currentJdbcValues array.  That obviously only matters when literals are used in the SELECT
* Remove `org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.cursor.spi.RefCursorSupport`.  Since we already baseline on Java 8there is
	no need for the reflection anymore
* Redesign `org.hibernate.cache.spi.entry.CacheEntryStructure` and friends (with better names) and make more
 	efficient.  At the moment, to cache, we:
.. Create a "cache entry" (object creation)
.. "structure" the "cache entry" (object creation)
.. add "structured data" to the cache.
+
--
Would be more efficient to combine (a) and (b).  Both are controlled by the persister anyway
--
* Handle `org.hibernate.query.QueryParameter#allowsMultiValuedBinding` for criteria queries
* While building Metadata during bootstrap, it is important to minimize Class loading - at least on the
	application ClassLoader (we can always safely load things on the "JPA temp ClassLoader").  To that end,
	the general process for determining the type of an attribute should be something like:
	** (Create HCANN such that it prefers the JPA temp ClassLoader if available.  See
		`BootstrapContextImpl#generateHcannClassLoaderDelegate`)
	** When we get an XProperty from HCANN check it for any of the annotations that indicate that this is a
		non-basic and non-embedded attribute.  The reason we check is that JPA says that any attribute
		not otherwise annotated is considered a basic attribute; however Hibernate does allow this for embedded
		as well - the Embeddable Class should not be loaded either.
	** If the attribute is deemed to be Basic then build the SimpleValue and pass in the "SiteContext"
		encompassing the XProperty.
			*** At this point it is safe to load the Class of the `XClass` from `XProperty#getType` at any
				time we need.
			*** Specifically, we would need this eventually to resolve the `JavaTypeDescriptor`, but again,
				we should delay this because later-known additional info could adjust the `JavaTypeDescriptor`
				we want to use.  Or is this all relative to the "SiteContext" and any information already
				known (config values, e.g.)?
			*** See if the SiteContext indicates a particular `SqlTypeDescriptor`.  If so, use it.  If not,
				ask the `JavaTypeDescriptor` for its `#getJdbcRecommendedSqlType` and use that.
			*** and so on..

== Could

These are things that could be done, and that might happen in 6.0 or it maye happen in 6.x.  We just are
not sure yet.

* Do we want to expose some form of Returns from Query objects as a sort of "result metadata"?  This would play
	the same role that Query returning Type does now (but Type is too limiting hence its removal)
* Allow "Java ServiceLoader" lookups to find contributors
* Drop support for loading an entity by passing the instance to populate ("optional entity instance" et al)


== Won't have ()

These are things we fully expect to not be in 6.0, alpha or otherwise, but that we want to implement.  They
might be done in 6.0 (again if resources allow), in 6.x or some `> 6` release.

* Session#stream API - accepts entity to stream, operations on the stream get translated to SQL up until a forEach etc call
* Consider splitting AST visitors/listeners into smaller pieces.  Good article on the subject -> http://jakubdziworski.github.io/java/2016/04/01/antlr_visitor_vs_listener.html
* Consider a common "model walker" useable for `org.hibernate.mapping` model as well as `org.hibernate.persister` via
	visitation contracts implemented in the tree + an external visitor.  This would also fit with users being able to
	do walk model using a custom visitor.  Not sure this is feasible or even desirable.
* `org.hibernate.tuple.ValueGenerator` currently only works with temporal values.  We need to extend that
	to also work with numeric values (for full "version" coverage).  Add a `#seed` method with a default
	impl (Java 8 ftw!) that simply call `#next`.  *This affects legacy uses of things like `DbTimestampValue`*


== Open questions

Unresolved/undecided design questions.

* See notes in `org.hibernate.metamodel.model.domain.spi.Navigable` and
	`org.hibernate.sql.results.spi.QueryResultProducer` regarding the current improper mixing of
	SQM and SQL AST concepts.

* Are we continuing to support mapping entities which do not maintain their id as an entity attribute?
* Move some methods from `EntityDescriptor` to more appropriate place:
	** methods relating to identifier (`#getIdentifier`, etc) ought to move to `EntityIdentifier`
	** methods relating to version (`#getVersion`, `#getCurrentVersion`, etc) ought to move to `VersionDescriptor`
	** methods relating to natural-id ought to move to `NaturalIdDescriptor`
* Move methods relating to the entity identifier from EntityDescriptor
* Should a natural-id be considered mutable/immutable based on mutability of its included attributes?
		ATM we rely on a specific configuration (`@org.hibernate.annotations.NaturalId#mutable`),
		but couldn't this be simplified to just look at the mutability of the attributes making up the
		natural-id?
* Should `org.hibernate.mapping.SimpleValue` just implement `org.hibernate.type.spi.BasicTypeParameters`?
		ATM I create an anonymous inner class, but `SimpleValue` implementing `BasicTypeParameters` would
		save an object creation every time we need to resolve a BasicType.  This part of the design is still
		fluid, so this may not be pertinent as we further implement this.  @andrea @chris
* `JTD#toString(Object)`, `JTD#fromString(String)`, `BasicType#toString(Object)` and
	`BasicType#fromString(String)` all seem worthless.  Can these just be handled via
	 `JTD#unwrap` and `JTD#wrap`?  May be a performance impact , but really... where are these used/useful?
	 Although WrapperOptions does come into play.
* Should we drop `JTD#areEquals`?  That is really the same thing as `JTD#getComparator().compare() == 0`.
 	*Assuming JTD comparator is never used for identity-based comparison*.
* Allow controlling "JPA strict compliance" per-query (hint)?
* New boot-time mapping contracts based on "managed type" classifications... keep in `org.hibernate.mapping`,
	or move to `org.hibernate.boot.model.domain`?
* Replacement for CollectionType -> initial thought is to have a "tuplizer" for collections, e.g.
+
--
	/**
	 * Encapsulates collection type specific behavior/information
	 * <p/>
	 * NOTE : the name "tuplizer" was chosen as this really serves
	 * same logical purpose as the entity and component tuplizers
	 * do entities and components respectively.
	 */
	interface CollectionTuplizer<C> {
		/**
		 * Access to the type of the collection.  This
		 * is expected to be an interface.  Used to create
		 * a registry against which we can resolve the
		 * reflected attribute type.  E.g. an attribute
		 * defined as `List` would be resolved to the
		 * CollectionTuplizer that deals with lists
		 */
		Class<C> getCollectionJavaType();

		/**
		 * Create an empty instance of the collection wrapper
		 */
		PersistentCollection<C> create(int anticipatedSize);

		/**
		 * Wrap an existing "raw" view of the collection
		 */
		PersistentCollection<C> wrap(Object rawCollection);

		/**
		 * Creates the representation of this plural attribute
		 * according to the runtime domain model view.
		 */
		<O> PluralPersistentAttribute<O,C,?> generatePluralAttribute();

		// anything else?  element comparator, etc?
	}
--
* support for Dialect "self initialization" - giving it access to information about the underlying database
		based on which it can configure itself differently.  The idea is to help cut down on the explosion of
		dialect classes just to handle some minor change in version X to version Y for database Z - e.g.
		have just one OracleDialect that configures itself based on the passed DatabaseMetadata.  Something like:
+
----
package org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.dialect.spi;

public interface DialectResolutionContext {
	DialectResolutionInfo getDialectResolutionInfo();

	ExtractedDatabaseMetaData getExtractedDatabaseMetaData();
}
----
+
Dialect impls could optionally choose to define a constructor accepting this `DialectResolutionContext`
to configure themselves.  However, we will not always have the "real" ExtractedDatabaseMetaData, e.g.
if configured to not acquire JDBC `DatabaseMetaData` (`hibernate.temp.use_jdbc_metadata_defaults`).



== Misc

=== Entity-type expressions

Test (and possibly implement) the combination stuff discussed on a hibernate-semantic-query repo PR
submitted by Gunnar, as outlined in thise following comment : https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-semantic-query/pull/3#issuecomment-145553684

I've copied the gist of that PR discussion here in case we drop that no-longer-used repo...
____
So my idea is based on a few premises.

First, the JPA spec only allows this in the WHERE clause. So these "entity type expressions" (the JPA term, section 4.6.17.5) are only allowed as a predicate. And specifically in conjunction with a limited set of predicate operators (=, <>, IN, NOT IN).

The above premises come directly from the JPA spec. Another premise I have is that one of the expressions in the predicate has to be a TYPE function; all other forms really would not make sense. Bearing in mind that an "entity type expression" can be either (a) a TYPE function expression, (b) a parameter or (c) a entity-type-literal and leaving operator out of the equation for now, we'd have the following combinations:

* `typeFunction` & `typeFunction`
* `typeFunction` & `parameter`
* `typeFunction` & `entityTypeLiteral`
* `parameter` & `entityTypeLiteral`

I argue that the last one makes no sense to allow. We can debate this one. But it is an important premise to the idea to recognize these expressions syntactically. Why? Because notice how, if we strip away the last combination, all the remaining combinations have at least one typeFunction expression. That would allow us to set up a special branch in the predicate rule to recognize this.

Why is this such an important distinction (syntactic versus semantic)? In a word, performance. Specifically here: time, speed. The approach you took (validating each token text as an entity name) is valid, and it works. But you have to realize that every token/context we ask Antlr to evaluate as an expression will now involve a call to check whether the thing is an entity (so a series of method calls and eventually at least 2 Map lookups); for every possible thing that could evaluate as an expression.

What is better, generally speaking, is to recognize that an expression should be an entity-type-expression based on syntax. The should be is important. Because now we move into syntactic analysis and semantic validation. So if during parsing we are able to recognize that this expression should be an entityTypeExpression, we can later validate that it is as we walk the parse tree. That will be a much more efficient check, because its limited.
____

A related discussion Andrea and I had regards possibly allowing a query to select the entity-type.  E.g.

----
select type(p) from Person p
----

Again, this is beyond what the JPA spec defines as supported so we don't have to support this.  But its doable,
but I am not sure it is "usable".  If we do end up supporting this, the best "result type" is the Class although
I am not sure how that would work with non-POJO models.
