 * This is the tuple-transformer that is applied at the execution level.
 * <p/>
 * As a design question, should this encapsulate just dynamic-instantiation and
 * {@link javax.persistence.Tuple} transformations?  Or, should this also
 * cover {@link org.hibernate.query.TupleTransformer}?  If we decide to handle
 * TupleTransformer here, we need to pass along the aliases; we may also
 * need to allow for nestable RowTransformers.  Currently this is only used
 * to encapsulate dynamic-instantiation and {@link javax.persistence.Tuple}
 * transformations
 *
 * @todo Answer the design question above
